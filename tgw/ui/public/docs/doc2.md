# Deploying in Edge Server
---
- The File format should be a .zip file
- There `should not be nodemodules folder or .psycache folders` inside that zip
- There should be an `Dockerfile`
- There should be an `.env` file
- .env file should have `CONTAINER_PORT=any port` variable


For now, our platform tested only for Reactjs and Flask. And also it will work only with docker. In future, we will support other platforms also.
